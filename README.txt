Data for the CVB3 antigenic profiling manuscript. 
README files in each folder describe folder content.

Codon_tables. Codon files for all samples.

Meansitediffsel. Mean positive site differential selection per site calculated for each sample. A subfolder is included with the positive differential selection of each replicate.

Meanmutdiffsel. Mean positive site differential selection per mutation calculated for each sample. A subfolder is included with the positive differential selection of each replicate.


Logoplots. Logoplots representing the mean positive differential selection values of positively selected mutations for each sample.


Capsid_roadmaps. Capsid roadmap with surface exposed residues colored according to the positive differential selection values obtained and labeled according to their position in the polyprotein.


Dms_view. Files for the interactive visualization of the antigenic profiles in dms-view (dms-view.github.io).


Biobank_results. Results of the neutralization screening performed for 140 human samples. Anonymized ID,	 sex and age of donors are indicated, together with collection date, ic50 obtained and sd error in ic50 calculation.


Neutralization_results. Results of the neutralization assays for the human and mouse sera with different CVB3 mutants and coxsackievirus B clinical strains. Contains the IC50 results of the neutralization assays for the human and mouse sera samples. Sample and virus tested are indicated, together with the ic50 obtained for the mutant and for the WT virus, and the fold change in the IC50. Also contains the neutralization titers of the different human sera samples for different coxsackievirus B clinical strains. 


Competition_assay. Data from the competition assay. The ratio between fluorescence signal obtained at 20hpi versus 8hpi for each mutant or wildtype virus is indicated.


Analysis_sites_muts. Tables used for the structural analyses and prediction of characteristics of the main escape sites and mutations. Contains a master table for conversion of polypeptide position to chain (VP) and residue.


Sequence_alignments. Alignment file of all available enterovirus A, B, and C full polyprotein sequences in BV-BRC (bv-brc.org) and the calculated Shannon entropy.


ML_code. Custom code used for the machine learning analyses in Mathematica.
